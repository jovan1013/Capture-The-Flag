DETECT UNEXPECTED FILES IN ZIP FILES



Steganalysis can be done with tools you might use yourself for other tasks.

The tool 7-Zip is used to zip and unzip files (compress/decompress files) in Windows. You can use it to detect steganography.



Step 1: Find the Zip Files

Using File Explorer, go to the ZipFileAnalysis directory and look at the files
Find the path at the top
Click after ZipFileAnalysis so that the full path is now visible and turns blue as shown in the screenshot below








Step 2:  Copy the Path from File Explorer

Hold the key Ctrl  and the letter a (to select the full path)
Release the Ctrl+a
Hold Ctrl + c (to copy the path) and release them

Step 3: Open 7-Zip

Find the search box in the middle of the task bar
Type 7-zip
Click 7-Zip File Manager at the top of the search results to open 7-Zip.
Step 4:  Paste the Path into 7-Zip

Click your mouse in the white box in 7-zip so that when you paste the path (next step), it looks like the screenshot below
To paste, use Ctrl + v (to paste the full path)
Press enter
You should now see two files ending with .jpg (not shown here)






Step 5:  Steganalysis using 7-Zip

Double Click each .jpg file to answer the questions
For the file ending in .pdf, choose Adobe Acrobat Reader
Note: To go up to the previous directory to find the second file, click the little yellow icon with a green arrow to the left of the path.

EMBED A ZIP FILE IN AN IMAGE


The steganography technique shown here uses the copy command.



You will embed a zip file into an image with copy.

Open a command prompt as shown in the cheat sheet.



Change to the CoverFileSecretFile directory, for example, use this command:



cd C:\Users\FESAdmin\Desktop\Steganalysis\Steganalysisv2\ZipFileAnalysis\CoverFileSecretFile

You should see an image and a text file. You will first need to create a zip file.

Step 1: Create a Zip File

Open File Explorer and go to the CoverFileSecretFile directory
Right-Click the file secret.txt
Left-Click Compress to ZIP file
Notice the new file called secret.zip (a yellow icon with a zipper).
Next, you will use the copy  command with the /b  option to combine the image and the zip file into one.



Step 2: Hide the Zip File into the Image with Copy

At the command prompt, run dir  to confirm that secret.zip exists
Run the following command:
copy /b vecteezydotcom2.jpg + secret.zip  resultsfile.jpg
Verify that results.jpg contains the zip file by using 7-ZIP as you did before.
If you only see an image, you probably used secret.txt instead of secret.zip. Try again.

Finally, from File Explorer, double-click resultsfile.jpg and you should see the image (unlike what you see in 7-Zip).


Note: The image looks normal and you cannot tell that it contains a zip file!

Tick the box if you can read the secret.txt file from 7-Zip
